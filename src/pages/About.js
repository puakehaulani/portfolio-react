                    I'm a full-stack web developer from O‘ahu, Hawai‘i, with a background in client relations.
                    Currently I am earning a Certificate in Web Development from the University of Washington.
                    I have strength in teamwork, listening, anticipating the needs of clients, and working in
                    fast paced
                    environments. I have skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and Node.js.
             </p><p>
                    My motivation comes from my insatiable curiosity and the endorphin rush from solving a
                    problem. I love to learn.
            </p><p>
                    I'm excited to find my technical niche. In the meantime, I plan to continue to
                    develop meaningful and intuitive websites that people will actually want to
                    use.
