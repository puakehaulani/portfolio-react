                    <p>
                        I'm a full-stack web developer from O‘ahu, Hawai‘i, with a background in service and client relations.
                        I earned a Certificate in Web Development from the University of Washington in 2021.
                        My strengths include teamwork, listening, anticipating the needs of clients, and working in
                        fast paced environments.
             </p><p>
                        My motivation comes from my insatiable curiosity and the endorphin rush from solving a
                        problem. I love to learn.
            </p><p>
                        If I'm not coding, I'm probably outside - snowboarding, paddling outrigger canoes, or hanging out at a dog park .
            </p><p>
                        I'm excited to find my technical niche. In the meantime, I plan to continue trying new things and taking on diverse projects.
